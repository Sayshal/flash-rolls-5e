Now, this setting should also work fine with Midi, so you can send requests to players for attacks and spell rools. Feel free to report any concerns!</li></ul>\n<p><b>If you like this module, consider supporting me on <a href='https://www.patreon.com/carolingiandev/membership'>Patreon</a>.</b></p><p>Join the discussion on <a href='https://discord.gg/P5ygvHXE3R'>Discord</a> or visit the <a href='https://github.com/crlngn/flash-rolls-5e/releases'>Github repository</a>.</p>",
